## CLI Manual

> [!TIP]
> Only [input_path] (either an image or a folder) is required. Most of the time, it can just be `phrame -i [input_path]` 

The fundamental function of this CLI is to add customizable frames to images. To add frame(s) to image(s), use the following command:

```
phrame -q -i [input_path] -o [output_path] -r [border_ratio] -c [frame_color]
```

Except the root command, there are two available subcommands: sign and cut. 
### Sign
This subcommand is used to add a signature (watermark) on the frame. I personally am not interested in anything that blinds any part of my photo so this tool is for you if you have same concerns.
The complete command goes like:
```
phrame sign -s [signature] -i [input_path] -o [output_path] -r [border_ratio] -c [frame_color] -x [font_size] -y [font_color]
```

To make it more customizable, it supports loading any font (.ttf) by simply replacing the default font (Inter-Regular) named by "font.ttf" with [whatever font you are fond of](https://fonts.google.com/). 
### CUT
The cut subcommand can be used to divide an image into either four or nine equal parts:
```
phrame cut [image_path] -g [4 or 9]
```
