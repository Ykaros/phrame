## CLI Manual
The fundamental function of this CLI is to add customizable frames to images. 

Except the root command, there are two available subcommands: sign and cut. 
### Sign
This subcommand is used to add a signature (watermark) to your framed images. I personally do not anything that blinds any part of my photo so this tool is for you if you have same concerns. 

To make it more customizable, it supports loading any font (.ttf) by simply replacing the default font (Inter-Regular) named by "font.ttf" with whatever font you are fond of. The complete command goes like:
``
### CUT
This subcommand is used to cut the image into several parts (either 4 or 9).
